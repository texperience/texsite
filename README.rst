texsite delivers great and ready-to-use page templates for the modern, flexible and user-focused web content management system `Wagtail CMS`_ backed by the popular `Django web framework`_, both written in `Python`_.

Based on the amazing `StreamField`_ introduced with Wagtail release 1.0, which texsite uses extensively, it has never been easier for editors to author awesome pages. Read more on how this concept works in the great blog article `Rich text fields and faster horses`_ written by Matt Westcott, lead technical developer of Wagtail.
